Hello,

This is my first machine learning assignment. The assignment (group assignment) given us was to select a study paper and attempt to replicate its results or outcomes in the study paper. I was a part of this assignment with my colleague, Ansh Shah.

The study paper we selected was:

Kaggle (//www.kaggle.com/datasets/pentakrishnakishore/diabetes-csv/data)
Name: Diabetes Prediction Dataset
All the details of the csv file are written on the kaggle website.

My repository contains the following files:

1. Results.ipynb: A notebook containing the results of the study.
2. Diabetes(1).csv: A CSV file containing the Diabetes Prediction Dataset.
3. Report file: A comprehensive document that includes all the results, plots, and algorithms utilized in the study paper.
